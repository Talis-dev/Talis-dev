# Hi, I'm Thalison Fernandes! 🚀

Industrial Automation & Controls Specialist | Full Stack Developer | CEO at Star Any Tech

With over 10 years of experience in the industrial sector—specifically in poultry processing—I bridge the gap between heavy industrial machinery and modern software solutions.

🛠 Technical Expertise

Industrial Automation: Expert in PLC, HMI, and SCADA systems design and programming.


Electrical Engineering: Specialist in low and medium voltage systems, control panel assembly, and technical troubleshooting.

Full Stack Development: Building industrial Web UI/UX and IoT applications using Relational & NoSQL Databases, C++,JavaScript, TypeScript,Next.js Node.js, and Python.

Hardware Innovation: Developing custom electronic boards and microcontroller prototypes (ESP32 & ARM-based Microcontrollers) to optimize industrial processes.

🔒 Private Projects & NDA
Most of my high-impact industrial projects—including custom SCADA systems and IoT monitoring tools—reside in private repositories due to Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA) and sensitive client data from the food processing industry. These solutions have successfully generated significant operational savings and qualified companies for federal innovation incentives (Lei do Bem).
